\section{Research Plan}
	It is apparent from the literature that operators and amplitude expressions in quantum chemistry have some low order format that can be taken advantage of as dimensionality in number of electrons increases.  It is therefore the goal for this research to apply modern computational architecure scaling tensor decomposition algorithms to reduce scaling of correlation methods based on MBPT, CC and CC-R12 methods.  THC is quantum chemistries first step into utilizing struture of tensors to reduce storage requirements without arbitarty truncation based on intrinics.  CP and Tucker decompositions have character from the full set of vectors which span the tensor space, unlike the truncated SVD or eigenvalue decomposition.
