abstract = {Density fitting is used to approximate all of the 4-index 2-electron integrals in the explicitly correlated MP2-R12 theory of Kutzelnigg and Klopper. The resulting method-DF-MP2-R12-requires only 2- and 3-index integrals over various 2-electron operators, and is extremely efficient. The errors arising from the fitting process can be made small by using robust fitting formulas throughout, such that the error in each fitted integral is quadratic in the error of the fitted orbital product densities. Sample calculations on glycine reveal that for large basis sets DF-MP2-R12 is faster than a standard MP2 calculation and takes only a small fraction of the time for the Hartree-Fock calculation.

abstract = {We apply density fitting approximations to generate the 2-electron integrals in local MP2 ͑LMP2͒ to produce a method denoted DF-LMP2. The method can equally be seen as a local version of the well-known RI-MP2 method, which in this work is referred to as DF-MP2. Local approximations reduce the asymptotic scaling of computational resources to O(N), and the most expensive step of DF-MP2 ͓the O(N 5 ͔ assembly͒ is rendered negligible in DF-LMP2. It is demonstrated that for large molecules DF-LMP2 is much faster ͑1–2 orders of magnitude͒ than either LMP2 or DF-MP2. The availablility of LMP2, DF-MP2 and DF-LMP2 has for the first time made it possible to assess the accuracy of local and density fitting approximations for extended molecules using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. The density fitting errors are found to be consistently small, but the errors arising from local approximations are somewhat larger than expected from calculations on smaller systems. It is proposed to apply local density fitting approximations also for the Fock matrix construction in Hartree-Fock calculations. Preliminary results demonstrate that this can lead to significant savings in the Hartree-Fock calculation.},

The new procedure will allow very large CCSD(T) calculations to be undertaken, limited only by available processor time.

abstract = {A new systematic way of constructing auxiliary basis functions for approximating the evaluation of electron repulsion integrals is proposed and applied to SCF and MCSCF wavefunction calculations. In the approximation, the one-electron density is expanded in terms of a linear combination of atomic electron distributions (LCAD), and the four-center two-electron repulsion integrals are reduced to the three- and two-center quantities. This results in a high-accuracy approximation as well as a large reduction in disk storage and input/output requirement, proportional to N3 rather than N4, N being the number of basis functions. Numerical results indicate that the error from the present approximation decreases as the size of molecular basis functions increases and that the LCAD version of MCSCF calculations requires only a fractional amount of the CPU time required in the conventional procedure without loss of accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Harshman1970,
abstract = {Simple structure and other common principles of factor rotation do not in general provide strong grounds for attributing explanatory significance to the factors which they select. In contrast, it is shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis for determining explanatory factors for three-way or higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data variation, system- and object-variation, and PP analysis is found to apply in the system-variation case. Although PP was originally formulated as a principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit and generalized frown two to N "parallel occasions". As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is demonstrated to give unique "correct" solutions with oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with synthetic data of known factor composition, demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear versions of the model, provide data on the minimal necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the properties of the analysis procedures when these minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of the solution given certain conditions on the data. Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a three-way set of real data consisting of the fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11 persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is extracted, consisting of three factors which are highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge and theory concerning vowel quality. The relationships between the three-mode PP model and Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional scaling model are explored.},

Part I. Theory and Methods. On the theory of atomic structure proposed by Bohr, in which the electrons are considered as point charges revolving in orbits about the nucleus, the Orbits being specified by quantum con-ditions, it is well known that both a qualitative and an approximate quantitative explanation of many features of the simpler optical spectra and of X-ray spectra of atoms with many electrons (e.g. Rydberg sequences in optical spectra, term magnitudes in both X-ray and optical spectra) can be given, if the assumption is made that the effects of the electrons on one another can be represented by supposing each to move in a central non-Coulomb field of force*; further, the additional concept of a spinning electron provides a similar explanation of other features of these specbraf (e.g. doublet struoture of terms and magnitude of doublet separation, anomalous Zeeman effect). This assumption of a central field was admittedly a rough approximation made in the absence of any detailed ideas about the interaction between the different electrons in an atom, but in view of its success as a first approximation for the orbital atom model, the question arises whether, the same simple approximations may not give useful results when applied to the new formulation of the quantum theory which has been developed in the last two years. The wave mechanics of Schrodinger{\}} appears to be the most suitable form of the new quantum theory to use for this purpose, and will be adopted throughout. Further, if i|r is a solution of the wave equation (suitably normalised), the suggestion has been made by Schrodinger, and developed by Klein , that |i/r| 2 gives the volume density of charge in the state described by this i/r; whether this interpretation is always applicable may be doubtful, but for the wave functions corresponding to closed orbits of elec-trons in an atom, with which alone this paper will be concerned, it has the advantage that it gives something of a model both of the stationary states (if i/r only contains one of the characteristic functions) and of the process of radiation (if i/r is the sum of * See, for example, M.

@article{Hartree1928a,
abstract = {The paper is concerned with the practical determination of the characteristic values and functions of the wave equation of Schrodinger for a non-Coulomb central field, for which the potential is given as a function of the distance r from the nucleus.The method used is to integrate a modification of the equation outwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution finite at r = 0, and inwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution zero at r = ∞, with a trial value of the parameter (the energy) whose characteristic values are to be determined; the values of this parameter for which the two solutions fit at some convenient intermediate radius are the characteristic values required, and the solutions which so fit are the characteristic functions ({\S}{\S} 2, 10).Modifications of the wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of the range of r are given ({\S}{\S} 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or of the trial value of the energy ({\S} 4); the use of these variation equations in preference to a complete new integration of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.For the range of r where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable, recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave equations which are zero at r = ∞, and correspond to terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out the integration in each particular case ({\S}{\S} 6, 7).Formulae for the calculation of first order perturbations due to the relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are given ({\S} 8).The method used for integrating the equations numerically is outlined ({\S} 9).},

Results from CCSDT agree with full CI, to an average error of less than 1 kcallmol even for difficult bond breaking examples.

The model space defines the zero-order or model wavefunction, and the new formalism makes it possible to use a model wave-function of multi-configurational type. The effect of the states outside the model space are as usual taken into account by means of a perturbation expansion and expressed in terms of an 'effective' Hamiltonian, operating only within the model space. The extended Rayleigh-Schrodinger formalism is used to prove the linked-diagram theorem for a multi-configura-tional model space in a simple way. Alternatively, this pfoblem can be handled by means of the well known formalism for degenerate perturbation, treating the splitting within the model space as due to an additional perturbation. The present approach, however, is more direct and the model space splitting is handled without summing any infinite series. The problem of convergence of the perturbation expansion is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Various aspects of electron correlation are reviewed, from a statistical interpretation of the concept of electron correlation to modern methods to treat correlation effects. Popular inconsistencies in the concept of electron correlation (in part related to an inappropriate normalization) are clarified. Current claims, e.g. that 'there is a Fermi correlation between electrons of the same spin, and no correlation between electrons of different spin', or that the 'Fermi hole integrates to -1', must at least be modified. It is stressed that Fermi-correlation has more to do with the removal of self-pairing than with genuine exchange. The usefulness of correlation coefficients to describe electron correlation is pointed out. Some less-known facts are stressed, like the possibility of positive (attractive) correlation, and the extremely strong negative correlation in unnatural parity singlet states. The importance of a formulation of the n-electron problem in Fock space is stressed, and a modern Fock space theory is presented. Excitation operators and k-particle density matrices playa central role. An important aspect of Fock-space theory is separability of operators, which is closely related to extensivity of properties. It is preferable to have a theory entirely in terms of additively separable quantities, such as e.g. the cluster amplitudes of coupled-cluster theory. While the kparticle density matrices are not additively separable (except for k=1), the cumulants of the k-particle density matrices are additively separable. These cumulants have additional attractive properties, which are likely to make them promising tools in the many-electron theory of the future. A generalization of normal ordering with respect to an arbitrary reference function is presented, that contains the traditional particlehole formalism as a special case, namely for a single Slater determinant reference function. Related to this generalized normal ordering is a generalized Wick theorem.},

abstract = {Atomic multiplets are treated by wave mechanics, without using group theory. In part 1 Hund's scheme for multiplet classification is derived directly from theory. Part 2 is devoted to the computation of the energy distances between multiplets, and comparison of these distances with experiment in some typical examples. There is no treatment of the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that has been done elsewhere, but only between one multiplet and another. It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory. The method of calculation of multiplet distances is described in sufficient detail, with the necessary tables of coefficients, etc., so that further checks with experiment could easily be made.},

@article{Sherrill2000,
abstract = {Hartree-Fock theory is fundamental to much of electronic structure theory. It is the basis of molecular orbital (MO) theory, which posits that each electron's motion can be described by a single-particle function (orbital) which does not depend explicitly on the instantaneous motions of the other electrons. Many of you have probably learned about (and maybe even solved prob- lems with) H¨ uckel MO theory, which takes Hartree-Fock MO theory as an implicit foundation and throws away most of the terms to make it tractable for simple calculations. The ubiquity of orbital concepts in chemistry is a testimony to the predictive power and intuitive appeal of Hartree-Fock MO theory. However, it is important to remember that these orbitals are mathematical constructs which only approximate reality. Only for the hydrogen atom (or other one-electron systems, like He+) are orbitals exact eigenfunctions of the full electronic Hamiltonian. As long as we are content to consider molecules near their equilibrium geometry, Hartree-Fock theory often provides a good starting point for more elaborate theoretical methods which are better approximations to the elec- tronic Schr¨ odinger equation (e.g., many-body perturbation theory, single-reference configuration interaction). So...how do we calculate molecular orbitals using Hartree-Fock theory? That is the subject of these notes; we will explain Hartree-Fock theory at an introductory level},

@article{Hartree1928b,
abstract = {The paper is concerned with the practical determination of the characteristic values and functions of the wave equation of Schrodinger for a non-Coulomb central field, for which the potential is given as a function of the distance r from the nucleus.The method used is to integrate a modification of the equation outwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution finite at r = 0, and inwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution zero at r = ∞, with a trial value of the parameter (the energy) whose characteristic values are to be determined; the values of this parameter for which the two solutions fit at some convenient intermediate radius are the characteristic values required, and the solutions which so fit are the characteristic functions ({\S}{\S} 2, 10).Modifications of the wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of the range of r are given ({\S}{\S} 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or of the trial value of the energy ({\S} 4); the use of these variation equations in preference to a complete new integration of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.For the range of r where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable, recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave equations which are zero at r = ∞, and correspond to terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out the integration in each particular case ({\S}{\S} 6, 7).Formulae for the calculation of first order perturbations due to the relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are given ({\S} 8).The method used for integrating the equations numerically is outlined ({\S} 9).},

Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition:CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above.
