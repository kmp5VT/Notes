Excitations are made from localized molecular orbitals into subspaces (domains) of the local basis, which strongly reduces the number of amplitudes to be optimized. Furthermore, the correlation of distant electrons can be treated in a simplified way (e.g., by MP2) or entirely neglected. It is demonstrated for 20 molecules that the local correlation treatment recovers 98{\%}–99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained in the corresponding full CCSD calculation.

Chem. Phys. 134, 044123 (2011)], to local coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (OSV-LCCSD). The method is implemented by modifying an efficient projected-atomic-orbital local coupled cluster program (PAO-LCCSD) described recently, [H.-J. Werner and M. Schütz, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 144116 (2011)]. By comparison of both methods we find that the compact representation of the amplitudes in the OSV approach affords various advantages, including smaller computational time requirements (for comparable accuracy), as well as a more systematic control of the error through a single energy threshold. Overall, the OSV-LCCSD approach together with an MP2 correction yields small domain errors in practical calculations. The applicability of the OSV-LCCSD is demonstrated for molecules with up to 73 atoms and realistic basis sets (up to 2334 basis functions).},

@article{Riplinger2013,
abstract = {In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) based singles- and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal∕mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30{\%}-50{\%} to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation. In addition to the linear C150H302 (452 atoms, {\textgreater}8800 basis functions) we demonstrate the first CCSD(T) level calculation on an entire protein, Crambin with 644 atoms, and more than 6400 basis functions.},

The possibility of variational collapse to an unphysical " attractive electron " state that can affect such density fitting [P. Merlot, T. Kjaergaard, T. Helgaker, R. Lindh, F. Aquilante, S. Reine, and T. B. Pedersen, J. Comput. Chem. 34, 1486 (2013)] is alleviated by including atom-wise semidiagonal integrals exactly. Our approach leads to a significant decrease in the computational cost of density fitting for Hartree–Fock theory while still producing results with errors 2–5 times smaller than standard, nonlocal density fitting. Our method allows for large Hartree–Fock and density functional theory computations with exact exchange to be carried out efficiently on large molecules, which we demonstrate by benchmarking our method on 200 of the most widely used prescription drug molecules. Our new fitting scheme leads to smooth and artifact-free potential energy surfaces and the possibility of relatively simple analytic gradients.},

abstract = {We present a general implementation of the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) and Cholesky decomposition (CD) representations of electron repulsion integrals within the coupled-cluster with single and double substitutions (CCSD) and equation-of-motion (EOM) family of methods. The CCSD and EOM-CCSD equations are rewritten to eliminate the storage of the largest four-index intermediates leading to a significant reduction in disk storage requirements, reduced I/O penalties, and, as a result, improved parallel performance. In CCSD, the number of rate-determining contractions is also reduced; however, in EOM the number of operations is increased because the transformed integrals, which are computed once in the canonical implementation, need to be reassembled at each Davidson iteration. Nevertheless, for large jobs the effect of the increased number of rate-determining contractions is surpassed by the significantly reduced memory and disk usage leading to a considerable speed-up. Overall, for medium-size examples, RI/CD CCSD calculations are approximately 40{\%} faster compared with the canonical implementation, whereas timings of EOM calculations are reduced by a factor of two. More significant speed-ups are obtained in larger bases, i.e., more than a two-fold speed-up for CCSD and almost five-fold speed-up for EOM-EE-CCSD in cc-pVTZ. Even more considerable speedups (6-7-fold) are achieved by combining RI/CD with the frozen natural orbitals approach. The numeric accuracy of RI/CD approaches is benchmarked with an emphasis on energy differences. Errors in EOM excitation, ionization, and electron-attachment energies are less than 0.001 eV with typical RI bases and with a 10(-4) threshold in CD. Errors with 10(-2) and 10(-3) thresholds, which afford more significant computational savings, are less than 0.04 and 0.008 eV, respectively.},

For this purpose, the wavefunction ansatz is formulated in an occupation number vector representation that ensures antisymmetry. If the canonical product format tensor decomposition is then applied, the Hamiltonian and the wavefunction can be cast into a multilinear product form. As a consequence, the number of wavefunction parameters does not scale to the power of the number of particles (or orbitals) but depends on the rank of the approximation and linearly on the number of particles. The degree of approximation can be controlled by a single threshold for the rank reduction procedure required in the algorithm. We demonstrate that using this approximation, the FCI Hamiltonian matrix can be stored with N5 scaling. The error of the approximation that is introduced is below Millihartree for a threshold of ϵ = 10−4 and no convergence problems are observed solving the FCI equations iteratively in the new format. While promising conceptually, all effort of the algorithm is shifted to the required rank reduction procedure after the contraction of the Hamiltonian with the coefficient tensor. At the current state, this crucial step is the bottleneck of our approach and even for an optimistic estimate, the algorithm scales beyond N10 and future work has to be directed towards reduction-free algorithms.},

abstract = {The configuration interaction (CI) is a versatile wave function theory for interacting fermions, but it involves an extremely long CI series. Using a symmetric tensor decomposition method, we convert the CI series into a compact and numerically tractable form. The converted series encompasses the Hartree-Fock state in the first term and rapidly converges to the full-CI state, as numerically tested by using small molecules. Provided that the length of the symmetric tensor decomposition CI series grows only moderately with the increasing complexity of the system, the new method will serve as one of the alternative variational methods to achieve full CI with enhanced practicability. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.253001 PACS numbers: 31.15.V{\`{A}}, 31.10.+z An accurate description of the ground-state wave func-tion of an interacting fermion system is one of the central goals of modern science. The most straightforward and versatile approach to describing this wave function is the configuration interaction (CI), but its numerical application is greatly limited by the fact that the full-CI series consists of M C N Slater determinants (SDs) when describing an N-electron system by using M basis functions. To truncate this extremely long CI series without compromising on chemical accuracy, many methods have been developed, such as the multireference CI, which uses a part of the SDs derived from a few of the most important ones, or the complete active space CI, which uses all SDs generated from a selected set of orbitals [1]. Even so, the application has been hampered by the slow convergency of the CI series. In this context, the many-body perturbation approaches to treat all SDs have attracted attention; these approaches include the coupled cluster theory [2,3], which is used to represent the wave function in terms of an SD (or a few SDs) applied with the exponential of an excitation opera-tor. The coupled cluster theory has proven accurate for a number of molecules, although it occasionally provides qualitatively incorrect potential surfaces [4]. The density matrix renormalization group method [5] has also attracted attention as a variational method within the space of the matrix product state [6]. It has been extensively applied to correlated electron systems [7,8]; however, this method was originally formulated only for one-dimensional sys-tems, and its extension to three-dimensional systems is not very straightforward. Recent tensor analyses have shown that, despite the large number, the CI coefficients may be described by a tractable number of variational parameters. For example, the full-CI results of some molecules were accurately reproduced by the complete-graph tensor network state containing {\$}M 2 variational parameters [9,10]. Tensor decomposition (TD) [11] methods such as the Tucker decomposition [12] and the canonical decomposition combined with the parallel factor decomposition, abbrevi-ated as CP [13,14], have also been applied to molecules. These methods were used to analyze the double excitation tensor T 2 originating from the electron-electron interac-tion [15,16]. The results showed that the T 2 tensor of rank 4, consisting of {\$}M 4 terms, can be described by {\$}MK parameters, where K denotes the length of the tensor decomposition [16]. The TD method was also suggested as being effective in greatly reducing the variational pa-rameters required for full CI [15]. In this context, we formulate a practical scheme to perform full-CI level calculation using a TD method. In this study, we describe the CI coefficients as a product of a symmetric tensor and the permutation tensor, and following the CP procedure we expand the former into K symmetric Kronecker product states, which are composed of vectors of dimension M. Subsequently, we calculate the second-order density matrix consisting of {\$}K 2 M 4 ele-ments using Vi{\`{e}}te's formula [17], thereby performing {\$}M 2 operations for each element. This allows us to per-form the total energy calculation variationally by using {\$}K 2 M 6 operations. Our test calculations for the potential surface of simple diatomic molecules and for a Hubbard cluster model with different parameters show that, with increasing K, the total energy rapidly converges to the full-CI result. This shows that our symmetric tensor decomposition (STD) CI scheme will greatly extend the applicability of the full-CI level calculation, provided that K increases only moderately with N, M, or the complexity of the electron correlation. In treating the interacting indistinguishable particles, the (anti)symmetric nature of the wave function plays a key role. In the STD CI scheme, the antisymmetric nature of electrons is directly treated by explicitly introducing the permutation tensor, reducing thereby the variational degree of freedom to a power of N, although it is N! in the conventional CI. Moreover, the application of this scheme is not restricted to one-dimensional systems, contrary to the density matrix renormalization group that is based on},

We discuss the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations using tensors in CP representation and present a tensor contraction scheme that minimizes the effort necessary for the rank reductions during the iterations.

@article{Roos1980,
abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1$\Sigma$+g, 3$\Sigma$+u and 3$\Pi$g) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) {\AA}; $\omega$e: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm-1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

The method can equally be seen as a local version of the well-known RI-MP2 method, which in this work is referred to as DF-MP2. Local approximations reduce the asymptotic scaling of computational resources to O(N), and the most expensive step of DF-MP2 ͓the O(N 5 ͔ assembly͒ is rendered negligible in DF-LMP2. It is demonstrated that for large molecules DF-LMP2 is much faster ͑1–2 orders of magnitude͒ than either LMP2 or DF-MP2. The availablility of LMP2, DF-MP2 and DF-LMP2 has for the first time made it possible to assess the accuracy of local and density fitting approximations for extended molecules using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. The density fitting errors are found to be consistently small, but the errors arising from local approximations are somewhat larger than expected from calculations on smaller systems. It is proposed to apply local density fitting approximations also for the Fock matrix construction in Hartree-Fock calculations. Preliminary results demonstrate that this can lead to significant savings in the Hartree-Fock calculation.},

abstract = {Simple structure and other common principles of factor rotation do not in general provide strong grounds for attributing explanatory significance to the factors which they select. In contrast, it is shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis for determining explanatory factors for three-way or higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data variation, system- and object-variation, and PP analysis is found to apply in the system-variation case. Although PP was originally formulated as a principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit and generalized frown two to N "parallel occasions". As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is demonstrated to give unique "correct" solutions with oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with synthetic data of known factor composition, demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear versions of the model, provide data on the minimal necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the properties of the analysis procedures when these minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of the solution given certain conditions on the data. Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a three-way set of real data consisting of the fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11 persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is extracted, consisting of three factors which are highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge and theory concerning vowel quality. The relationships between the three-mode PP model and Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional scaling model are explored.},

With these functions, three- and four-electron integrals occur, but these integrals can be avoided by inserting a resolution of the identity (RI) in terms of the one-electron basis. In previous work, only one single basis was used for both the electronic wave function and the RI approximation.

Part I. Theory and Methods. On the theory of atomic structure proposed by Bohr, in which the electrons are considered as point charges revolving in orbits about the nucleus, the Orbits being specified by quantum con-ditions, it is well known that both a qualitative and an approximate quantitative explanation of many features of the simpler optical spectra and of X-ray spectra of atoms with many electrons (e.g. Rydberg sequences in optical spectra, term magnitudes in both X-ray and optical spectra) can be given, if the assumption is made that the effects of the electrons on one another can be represented by supposing each to move in a central non-Coulomb field of force*; further, the additional concept of a spinning electron provides a similar explanation of other features of these specbraf (e.g. doublet struoture of terms and magnitude of doublet separation, anomalous Zeeman effect). This assumption of a central field was admittedly a rough approximation made in the absence of any detailed ideas about the interaction between the different electrons in an atom, but in view of its success as a first approximation for the orbital atom model, the question arises whether, the same simple approximations may not give useful results when applied to the new formulation of the quantum theory which has been developed in the last two years. The wave mechanics of Schrodinger{\}} appears to be the most suitable form of the new quantum theory to use for this purpose, and will be adopted throughout. Further, if i|r is a solution of the wave equation (suitably normalised), the suggestion has been made by Schrodinger, and developed by Klein , that |i/r| 2 gives the volume density of charge in the state described by this i/r; whether this interpretation is always applicable may be doubtful, but for the wave functions corresponding to closed orbits of elec-trons in an atom, with which alone this paper will be concerned, it has the advantage that it gives something of a model both of the stationary states (if i/r only contains one of the characteristic functions) and of the process of radiation (if i/r is the sum of * See, for example, M.

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the practical determination of the characteristic values and functions of the wave equation of Schrodinger for a non-Coulomb central field, for which the potential is given as a function of the distance r from the nucleus.The method used is to integrate a modification of the equation outwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution finite at r = 0, and inwards from initial conditions corresponding to a solution zero at r = ∞, with a trial value of the parameter (the energy) whose characteristic values are to be determined; the values of this parameter for which the two solutions fit at some convenient intermediate radius are the characteristic values required, and the solutions which so fit are the characteristic functions ({\S}{\S} 2, 10).Modifications of the wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of the range of r are given ({\S}{\S} 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or of the trial value of the energy ({\S} 4); the use of these variation equations in preference to a complete new integration of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.For the range of r where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable, recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave equations which are zero at r = ∞, and correspond to terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out the integration in each particular case ({\S}{\S} 6, 7).Formulae for the calculation of first order perturbations due to the relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are given ({\S} 8).The method used for integrating the equations numerically is outlined ({\S} 9).},

The extended Rayleigh-Schrodinger formalism is used to prove the linked-diagram theorem for a multi-configura-tional model space in a simple way. Alternatively, this pfoblem can be handled by means of the well known formalism for degenerate perturbation, treating the splitting within the model space as due to an additional perturbation.

abstract = {The characteristics of particle motion in the$\backslash$nnuclear medium have been examined in detail. The$\backslash$norigin of the strong dependence of the potential$\backslash$nenergy on the nucleon momentum is discussed and an$\backslash$nequivalent formulation is exhibited in which a$\backslash$nuniform and constant potential is assumed but the$\backslash$nnucleon moves with markedly reduced mass. The$\backslash$ndetermination of the potential is shown to lead to a$\backslash$nself-consistency problem which is to some extent$\backslash$nsimilar to that appearing in the Hartree method of$\backslash$nself-consistent fields. Solution of this problem$\backslash$nshows that the self-consistency requirements impose$\backslash$nsevere restrictions on the solution and have a$\backslash$nstrong stabilizing influence in the saturation$\backslash$nproblem. The volume energy of the nucleus has been$\backslash$nevaluated by using two-body potentials closely$\backslash$nequivalent to a combination of central and tensor$\backslash$nforces which agree with the low-energy parameters$\backslash$nand predict scattering correctly up to 90 Mev. The$\backslash$nresult agress closely with the observed values of$\backslash$nenergy and density. The collective character of the$\backslash$nnucleon potential is described and shown to manifest$\backslash$nitself markedly in the excitation energy of$\backslash$nsingle-particle levels where a considerable fraction$\backslash$nof the energy is taken up in small adiabatic shifts$\backslash$nof the states of the remaining nucleons. The origin$\backslash$nof the surface and symmetry energy is discussed; an$\backslash$nevaluation of these effects gives a result in good$\backslash$nagreement with empirically derived values. The$\backslash$nstability of the nucleus against distorition arising$\backslash$nfrom the polarizing effects of the tensor force is$\backslash$nalso examined and it is found that the nucleus shows$\backslash$nmarked stability against such distortion.},

abstract = {An approximation method developed previously to deal with many particles in strong interaction is examined in further detail. It is shown that the series giving the interaction energy is a development in a sequence of linked or irreducible cluster terms each of which gives a contribution to the energy proportional to the total number of particles. Consequently the convergence of the expansion is independent of the total number of particles. The origin of this simple feature is illustrated by showing that a similar situation exists in the expansion of standard perturbation theory. The numerical convergence of the expansion is quantitatively discussed for the nuclear problem where it is shown that the correction arising from the first cluster term involving three particles is less than the leading term by a factor of about 10-4. The smallness of the correction is largely a result of the action of the exclusion principle.},

abstract = {Various aspects of electron correlation are reviewed, from a statistical interpretation of the concept of electron correlation to modern methods to treat correlation effects. Popular inconsistencies in the concept of electron correlation (in part related to an inappropriate normalization) are clarified. Current claims, e.g. that 'there is a Fermi correlation between electrons of the same spin, and no correlation between electrons of different spin', or that the 'Fermi hole integrates to -1', must at least be modified. It is stressed that Fermi-correlation has more to do with the removal of self-pairing than with genuine exchange. The usefulness of correlation coefficients to describe electron correlation is pointed out. Some less-known facts are stressed, like the possibility of positive (attractive) correlation, and the extremely strong negative correlation in unnatural parity singlet states. The importance of a formulation of the n-electron problem in Fock space is stressed, and a modern Fock space theory is presented. Excitation operators and k-particle density matrices playa central role. An important aspect of Fock-space theory is separability of operators, which is closely related to extensivity of properties. It is preferable to have a theory entirely in terms of additively separable quantities, such as e.g. the cluster amplitudes of coupled-cluster theory. While the kparticle density matrices are not additively separable (except for k=1), the cumulants of the k-particle density matrices are additively separable. These cumulants have additional attractive properties, which are likely to make them promising tools in the many-electron theory of the future. A generalization of normal ordering with respect to an arbitrary reference function is presented, that contains the traditional particlehole formalism as a special case, namely for a single Slater determinant reference function. Related to this generalized normal ordering is a generalized Wick theorem.},

It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory.

abstract = {Hartree-Fock theory is fundamental to much of electronic structure theory. It is the basis of molecular orbital (MO) theory, which posits that each electron's motion can be described by a single-particle function (orbital) which does not depend explicitly on the instantaneous motions of the other electrons. Many of you have probably learned about (and maybe even solved prob- lems with) H¨ uckel MO theory, which takes Hartree-Fock MO theory as an implicit foundation and throws away most of the terms to make it tractable for simple calculations. The ubiquity of orbital concepts in chemistry is a testimony to the predictive power and intuitive appeal of Hartree-Fock MO theory. However, it is important to remember that these orbitals are mathematical constructs which only approximate reality. Only for the hydrogen atom (or other one-electron systems, like He+) are orbitals exact eigenfunctions of the full electronic Hamiltonian. As long as we are content to consider molecules near their equilibrium geometry, Hartree-Fock theory often provides a good starting point for more elaborate theoretical methods which are better approximations to the elec- tronic Schr¨ odinger equation (e.g., many-body perturbation theory, single-reference configuration interaction). So...how do we calculate molecular orbitals using Hartree-Fock theory? That is the subject of these notes; we will explain Hartree-Fock theory at an introductory level},

Part I. Theory and Methods. On the theory of atomic structure proposed by Bohr, in which the electrons are considered as point charges revolving in orbits about the nucleus, the Orbits being specified by quantum con-ditions, it is well known that both a qualitative and an approximate quantitative explanation of many features of the simpler optical spectra and of X-ray spectra of atoms with many electrons (e.g. Rydberg sequences in optical spectra, term magnitudes in both X-ray and optical spectra) can be given, if the assumption is made that the effects of the electrons on one another can be represented by supposing each to move in a central non-Coulomb field of force*; further, the additional concept of a spinning electron provides a similar explanation of other features of these specbraf (e.g. doublet struoture of terms and magnitude of doublet separation, anomalous Zeeman effect). This assumption of a central field was admittedly a rough approximation made in the absence of any detailed ideas about the interaction between the different electrons in an atom, but in view of its success as a first approximation for the orbital atom model, the question arises whether, the same simple approximations may not give useful results when applied to the new formulation of the quantum theory which has been developed in the last two years. The wave mechanics of Schrodinger{\}} appears to be the most suitable form of the new quantum theory to use for this purpose, and will be adopted throughout. Further, if i|r is a solution of the wave equation (suitably normalised), the suggestion has been made by Schrodinger, and developed by Klein , that |i/r| 2 gives the volume density of charge in the state described by this i/r; whether this interpretation is always applicable may be doubtful, but for the wave functions corresponding to closed orbits of elec-trons in an atom, with which alone this paper will be concerned, it has the advantage that it gives something of a model both of the stationary states (if i/r only contains one of the characteristic functions) and of the process of radiation (if i/r is the sum of * See, for example, M.

abstract = {A new approximation for post-Hartree-Fock (HF) methods is presented applying tensor decomposition techniques in the canonical product tensor format. In this ansatz, multidimensional tensors like integrals or wavefunction parameters are processed as an expansion in one-dimensional representing vectors. This approach has the potential to decrease the computational effort and the storage requirements of conventional algorithms drastically while allowing for rigorous truncation and error estimation. For post-HF ab initio methods, for example, storage is reduced to O(d{\textperiodcentered}R{\textperiodcentered}n) with d being the number of dimensions of the full tensor, R being the expansion length (rank) of the tensor decomposition, and n being the number of entries in each dimension (i.e., the orbital index). If all tensors are expressed in the canonical format, the computational effort for any subsequent tensor contraction can be reduced to O(R(2){\textperiodcentered}n). We discuss details of the implementation, especially the decomposition of the two-electron integrals, the AO-MO transformation, the M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energy expression and the perspective for coupled cluster methods. An algorithm for rank reduction is presented that parallelizes trivially. For a set of representative examples, the scaling of the decomposition rank with system and basis set size is found to be O(N(1.8)) for the AO integrals, O(N(1.4)) for the MO integrals, and O(N(1.2)) for the MP2 t(2)-amplitudes (N denotes a measure of system size) if the upper bound of the error in the l(2)-norm is chosen as $\epsilon$ = 10(-2). This leads to an error in the MP2 energy in the order of mHartree.},

This gives a rough outline of how, after decomposition, one can reduce the memory requirements of calculating physical values and reduce the computations by using a separation model on MP2 energy

@article{Kolda2008,
abstract = {This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their applications, and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or N-way array. Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N-way arrays with N ≥ 3) have applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition:CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},
